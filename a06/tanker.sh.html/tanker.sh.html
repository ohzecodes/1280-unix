<p>Write an sh script, tanker.sh, that simulates a storage tank being filled and drained.</p>
<ul>
<li>accept one command line argument: a number representing the maximum storage capacity of the tank</li>
<li>starts the tank as empty, and as neither filling nor draining</li>
<li>upon receiving the USR1 signal, the tank begins to fill at a rate of 1 unit per second</li>
<li>upon receiving the USR2 signal, the tank begins to drain at a rate of 1 unit per second</li>
<li>while filling or draining, the tank should print its state, once per second</li>
<li>upon receiving the INT signal, the tank stops filling or draining</li>
<li>the tank cannot be both filling and draining at the same time, it can only be one or the other, or neither</li>
<li>on any state change, the tank should print a status message</li>
<li>if the tank overflows, the script exits with failure</li>
<li>if the tank empties, the script exits with failure</li>
<li>upon receiving TERM, the program exits with success (assuming it has not overflowed or drained)</li>
<li>use the "sleep" command to control the rate of fill/drain
<ul>
<li>your script will not respond to signals while it is in the sleep state</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Show me your progress at the end of lab, you are allowed to collaborate with your neighbours and/or work in pairs.&nbsp; There must be working code for every group of 2 people.</p>
